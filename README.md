# TrafficGuardian :The-Traffic-Signal-Detector Web App üö¶üö∏

TrafficGuardian is a web app that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and classify traffic signals from images. This project aims to provide an efficient solution for automated traffic signal recognition, which can be used in various applications such as autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring systems, and smart city initiatives.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images containing traffic signals through a simple user interface.
- **Detection and Classification**: The application employs computer vision algorithms to detect and classify traffic signals in the uploaded images.
- **Instant Results**: Users receive instant detection and classification results displayed on the web interface, providing real-time feedback.
- **Accuracy**: The detection and classification models used in the application have been trained on large-scale datasets [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign), ensuring accurate recognition of various traffic signal types with 98% accuracy.
- **Accessibility**: The web application is accessible through any modern web browser, making it convenient for users to utilize across different devices.

## Usage

1. Visit the Traffic Signal Detection web application. [Open App](https://trafficguardian.streamlit.app/)
2. Upload an image containing traffic signals.
4. View the instant detection and classification results displayed on the interface, including the type of traffic signal detected.

## Technologies Used
